## [0.1.0] — 2026-07-25

First public release. Extracted from a private in-repo client, reconciled against
the live ab0t Auth Service OpenAPI 3.1 spec, and published under its own module
path `github.com/ab0t-com/auth-sdk-go`.

### Added
- `DeleteCurrentUser` — `DELETE /users/me`, the GDPR / right-to-erasure
  self-delete flow, guarded by a confirm-email match. Previously the endpoint had
  no representation in the SDK at all, so a consumer offering "delete my account"
  had to hand-roll the call and re-derive the confirmation contract.
- `/mesh/providers` service-discovery surface — `ListMeshProviders`,
  `GetMeshProvider`, `PublishMeshProvider`, with `MeshProvider`,
  `MeshProviderPublishRequest/Response` and the tier types. The whole subsystem
  was previously absent.
- `BulkCheckResults.Allowed(i)` and `.AllAllowed()` helpers. Both fail CLOSED:
  an out-of-range index and an empty result set are `false`, because "nothing was
  checked" is not "everything is permitted".
- `Version`, reported in the `User-Agent` of every request so the service can
  attribute traffic and identify clients running a version with a known-bad
  contract.

### Fixed
- **`ZanzibarCheckBulk` returned an error on every successful call.** The live
  spec defines the `check/bulk` 200 as a bare JSON **array** of
  `CheckPermissionResponse`; the SDK decoded it into a struct with a `results`
  map, so every response failed with `json.UnmarshalTypeError` even when the
  server had answered correctly. This was an honest best-effort guess made while
  the server had no declared response schema — the server has since declared one.
- **The JWKS cache was unbounded.** `OrgJWKS` keyed one entry per organization
  and nothing ever evicted, so a long-lived multi-tenant process grew the map by
  one entry per distinct org ever seen, for the life of the process. It is now
  bounded (512 entries) with stalest-first eviction; eviction only ever costs a
  refetch.

### Changed
- **BREAKING:** module path is `github.com/ab0t-com/auth-sdk-go`.
- **BREAKING:** `ZanzibarCheckBulk` now returns `BulkCheckResults`
  (`[]CheckPermissionResponse`, in request order) instead of `*BulkCheckResponse`.
  The old type is removed; it could not decode a real response.
- `User-Agent` no longer names one particular consumer.

### Known gaps
- Four `authzmodel.go` methods (`ReadAuthorizationModel`,
  `ListAuthorizationModels`, `WriteAuthorizationModel`,
  `WriteAndDeleteRelationships`) target routes the auth service does not expose
  yet. They are shipped as forward-looking stubs, each carrying a `SERVER-GAP`
  doc note, and `TestAuthorizationModel_IsStillAServerGap` records executably
  that they 404 today. When the server ships those routes, that test starts
  failing — which is the signal to remove the warnings.
- Non-idempotent `POST`s are retried on 429/5xx. This is deliberate and tested,
  but it means a create call whose write committed before the response was lost
  can be applied twice on an endpoint with no natural dedup key. Use
  `WithMaxRetries(0)` on calls where once-only semantics matter. See README.
